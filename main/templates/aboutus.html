          <p class="lead">While registering for the event no one would have thought that this event would last so long.<br>
            Having qualified for idea submission, we were very excited, a lot of ideas popped into our mind, some seemingly difficult some easy, members put up a lot of ideas on the table, one said maybe we can develop a software that would find the safest path to travel from a source to destination, the other that maybe we could develop an automated drone that could tackle an enemy drone swarm, one will admit that ideas were diverse, at a point we were considering to build a catapult powered drone for last-mile delivery of amazon packets. We were ambitious indeed. <br><br>Lastly, we decided to build an application that would simply ”Turn off the light”. What does a man desire when he is so tired that he falls asleep? that someone turns that bulb off. This stuck to us as a great idea. Something that has novelty and nobility in it. We believe that this seemingly simple idea can make a lot of difference in the life of people who suffer from nyctophobia or similar disorders. <br>
We are proud of being able to develop a prototype of our application.

          <p class="lead">We are thankful to everyone who helped us in completing this project, Our teachers, to whom we owe the greatest respect, for making us curious and knowledgable enough that we were able to complete this project.<br> We owe our thanks to our parents for all they have given us .we would sincerely like to thanks Deloitte for seeing the potential in this idea which was quite an inspiration for us.
Developing this project was not easy, we had to iterate again and. This project consisted of many subparts, namely embedded systems, backend development, frontend development, then we also had to study about Google firebase, IBM server. But we were able to sail through all these challenges and were finally able to complete this project.
Had it not been the good wishes of the people mentioned above, we are quite sure, completing this project would have been a bigger challenge.
